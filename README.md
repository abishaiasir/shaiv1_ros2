🔧 I've embarked on a journey to develop an affordable and versatile robot using 3D printed parts and affordable materials. By creatively repurposing materials, I'm striving to make robotics accessible to more enthusiasts like myself.

🛠️ The robot's sturdy frame is crafted from reused aluminum profiles, providing a solid foundation for the project. I've leveraged the power of 3D printing to design custom brackets for the DC motors, keeping costs low and ensuring a perfect fit.

📟 As a low-level controller, I've chosen the Arduino Uno R3, a reliable and cost-effective option that allows me to efficiently interface with the motors and encoders from Cytron. It enables seamless communication between the hardware components and the ROS2 ecosystem.

💻 The brain of the robot is an old laptop that I managed to acquire at a fantastic price, proving that innovation doesn't always require the latest and most expensive hardware. With this resourceful approach, I aim to demonstrate the potential of repurposed technology in robotics projects.

👁️🗨️ The rplidar A1m8-R6, which significantly enhances the robot's perception capabilities. While it was a significant investment, it's an indispensable component for my project's success.

🌱 Throughout this journey, I'm embracing the spirit of open-source collaboration by using ROS2. This allows me to leverage the power of a vibrant community, enabling faster development and access to cutting-edge features.

💡 I can't wait to share more updates and showcase the potential of affordable and accessible robotics. Stay tuned for further progress on my LinkedIn journey, and I hope to inspire others to embark on their own creative robotics projects. Let's build a more inclusive and innovative robotics community together! 🤝
